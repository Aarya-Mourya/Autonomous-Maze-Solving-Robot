# Autonomous-Maze-Solving-Robot

- An autonomous robot is a category of robot that can perform tasks intelligently depending on themselves, without any human assistance.  
Maze Solving Robot is one of the most popular autonomous robots. 
- It is a small self-reliant robot that can solve a maze from a known starting position to the center area of the maze in the shortest possible time. 
- A maze-solving robot makes multiple runs in a maze, first, it creates a map of the maze layout
- The main aim of this project is to make an Arduino-based efficient autonomous maze solver robot. 
- Simple maze-solving algorithm “Wall following algorithm” and collision avoidance concepts are used to make this robot. 
A 3-Wheel Simple Maze Solving Robot that could navigate through a simple maze without colliding with any of the walls. Our objective was to design and develop a 2-wheel Simple Maze Solving Robot that could navigate through a simple maze without colliding with any of the walls. The robot was equipped with:-
