# Autonomous-Maze-Solving-Robot
Our objective was to design and develop a 2-Wheel Simple Maze Solving Robot that could navigate through a simple maze without colliding to any of the walls. To build this Robot :-

1. L298N Motor Driver.
2. Arduino UNO board.
3. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor.
4. TowerPro SG 90 Micro Servo Motor.
5. BO Series 1 100RPM Plastic Gear DC Motors.
6. 65mm Robot Wheels (Yellow) for the BO Motors.
7. Acrylic Chassis for 2-wheel Robot.
8. Some Screws and Nut Bolts to assemble all parts together.
9. Jumper Wires
