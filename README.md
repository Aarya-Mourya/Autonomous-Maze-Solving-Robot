# Autonomous-Maze-Solving-Robot

- An autonomous robot is a category of robot that can perform tasks intelligently depending on themselves, without any human assistance.  
- It is a small self-reliant robot that can solve a maze from a known starting position to the center area of the maze in the shortest possible time. 
- Simple maze-solving algorithm “Wall following algorithm” and collision avoidance concepts are used to make this robot. 
- A 3-wheel Simple Maze Solving Robot that could navigate through a simple maze without colliding with any of the walls. We aimed to design and develop a 2-wheel Simple Maze Solving Robot that could navigate through a simple maze without colliding with any of the walls. The robot was equipped with:-

The Arduino-based autonomous maze-solving robot project successfully addressed the maze-solving problem using the wall following algorithm concepts. The project demonstrated the importance of decision-making algorithms in robotics, and the robot's hardware and software development were accomplished. The maze construction was an essential part of the project, and the performance testing verified that the robot efficiently solved the maze. Overall, this project provided valuable insights into the field of robotics and presented a fun and challenging opportunity to apply programming and electronics skills. Further development of this project could lead to the creation of more advanced and sophisticated autonomous robots capable of solving complex mazes and exploring unknown environments.
